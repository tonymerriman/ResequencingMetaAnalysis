# ResequencingMetaAnalysis
Our aim is to compile a large database of publicly available GWAS data related to the genetic architecture of obesity, type-II diabetes and kidney function. From this reference data set, we aim to extract candidate SNPs / genes that are highly associated with these diseases which we will specifically target in a similar study of Polynesian populations.
