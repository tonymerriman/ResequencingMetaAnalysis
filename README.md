# ResequencingMetaAnalysis
Our aim is to compile a large database of publicly available GWAS data related to the genetic architecture of obesity, type-II diabetes and kidney function. From this reference data set, we aim to extract candidate SNPs / genes that are highly associated with these diseases which we will specifically target in a similar study of Polynesian populations.

### Phases  

 - __Phase 1:__  identify the most recent large scale meta-analyses from the literature.  
 - __Phase 2:__  from these studies, obtain the relevant data sets.  
 - __Phase 3:__  replicate the association studies for each of these data sets and extract the top 20 loci by population (emphasis on European and Asian populations).  
 - __Phase 4:__  map targeted loci to candidate genes. This will require clear criteria for selection of the genes (proximity?, biological importance?).    
 - __Phase 5:__  compile appropriate exons, promoters, 3' / 5' UTR sequences.  
 - __Phase 6:__  where appropriate also target regulatory regions.
